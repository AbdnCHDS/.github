# Welcome
Welcome to the GitHub site for the Aberdeen Centre for Health Data Science! 

The Centre is a partnership between the University of Aberdeen, NHS Grampian, and NHS Research & Development North Node. We bring together health and data science experts with clinical colleagues, industry, and the public to establish a vibrant, multidisciplinary research environment. Together we strive to address the heath challenges faced within our local community, nationally, and across the globe.

We aim to share all the research analysis code and tools we develop, and promote open and reproducible research practices.
